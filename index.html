                    My name is Tom and I am from Hong Kong. I came here in 2014 and studied at the South Puget Sound Community College with my psychology major. I've been lived in Olympia for about 2 years then I moved up to Seattle. I love living here because of the environment can gives me the freshest atmosphere every day.

                <div id="two">My major is psychology and I am graduated from the University of Washington. Right now I am studying the programming because I think I can have a better chance to serve this society by helping the company to accomplish their missions.</div>

                <br>

                <div id="three">Coding is the most part that I've ever wanted to learn it because I think create an application or software is very miracle. Hope there is one day I can create my own software to improve this society's living quality.</div>
